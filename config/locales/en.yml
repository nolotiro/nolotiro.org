    faq:
      answer_1_html: |2-

        The fundamental purpose of this website is to get rid of items you no longer use and hinder you at home.
      answer_2_html: 'First asking you directly get rid of those things you no longer want, and always to give something implicitly. It is best to approach it selfishly and control the cause-effect relationship that will trigger giving. <br> If we approach the act of giving objects from a selfish perspective, to get rid of useful things, but that bother us, because we clutter, because they will go away, because they are hopeless objects ... always we have a good experience, not expecting anything more to get rid of those objects. <br> And knowing that someone is giving profit use or enhance the experience as positive. <br> words: the act of giving things of value or useful is always a positive thing if we do not expect a moral reward or appease our conscience.'
      answer_3_html: On this website you have absolute power over the decision of who, where and when you give away your valuables. <br> Of course the ideal is to give something to the person who most need it. <br> Not misunderstand the way we use the word selfishness here. But to know if the person you're going to give an object deserves it is a very difficult task, and fosters a type of behavior that lead to bad experiences and value judgments that can do great damage.
      answer_4_html: 'Although the chances that traffickers used stuffed animals prowl through this web are quite remote, if so ... would not mind in the least if your focus is to get rid of things you do not want (the selfish). <Br > As you hear: No matter, it''s more, but not what you think you keep doing something good <br> If you gave objects because they wore and did not know what to do with them, but neither wanted to throw away''ve done well. <. br> You''ve done well with you, and that object has returned to <a href="http://www.lapetiteclaudine.com/archives/009217.html"> world of useful things, saving money </a> people and energy, generating wealth (albeit little, is wealth). If, however, this answer does not convince you then you should not give anything away here and sell or donate to an NGO, where they monitor and selection of such people in need (we can not guarantee that process).'
      answer_5_html: 'There are only 2 kinds of ads: The Gift, which offer items that will hinder or no longer want to have. And the want ads, which serve to provide clues and inspire people about what kind of objects you want to use or possess other people. <br> <Strong> change ads, sale, asking for money from employment, trade, drugs etc. are not allowed. </ strong> they are deleted as soon as it detects a moderator, publish repeatedly if unwanted ads, you can proceed to block the user''s account.'
      answer_6_html: Barter is a system that works very well in physical format, that is, two people face to face, seeing objects and speaking live. But internet barter is very likely to end in deception or dissatisfaction and endless discussions <br> addition as you've read earlier, here objects are given without conditions and barter is the conditioning of the quid pro quo, ie. Tu me give and I give you anything like it.
      answer_7_html: Surprisingly many people do, and there's nothing wrong with that shipments are made, but must have a minimum of caution with the seriousness of the receiver have been cases where someone of good faith has made paying shipping costs and then has a result that has returned the package. Ideally, do not, should be encouraged to circulate objects as close as possible, saving energy, and can serve to get to know the people of your city. <br> Hope that in the new version, we have focused a local concept is achieved. <br> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Globally,_Act_Locally"> think globally. </a>
      question_1: What is the goal of this project?
      question_2: So.. ¿Isn't this web to help other people?
      question_3: But, I would like to give my stuff as a present to someone who really need it
      question_4: Is it  true that some people sell the stuff given by free in this site?
      question_5: What kind of ads can i publish on this site?
      question_6: |2-

        Is it not allowed to exchange objects? thats weird
      question_7: Can I send things to people who do not live in my city?
